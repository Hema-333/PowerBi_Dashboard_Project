HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Dashboard 

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project. I recently built an HR Analytics Dashboard. This dashboard is focused on employee attrition analysis, giving HR leaders visibility into workforce trends. Some of the key insight include:

âš« Workforce Overview
 
 1) Total Employees: 961
 2) Attrition Count: 133
 3) Attrition Rate: 0.14
 4) Average Age: 37
 5) Average Age Salary: 6.28K 
 6) Average Years: 6.86

âš« Overall Insight: The company is experiencing high attrition particularly among younger employees in sales role with lower salaries and fewer years of service.

âš« Skills Used in Building HR Analytics 
 Dashboard 

 a) Power BI Development:- Use of DAX(Data Analysis Expressions) for measure like attrition rate, averages, etc. Design interactive visuals (slicer, filters, bar/line charts, pie charts)
 b) Data Analysis:- KPI design (attrition %, average salary, tenure etc). Building calculated fields (e.g. attrition by salary slab).
 
ðŸš€ HR Analytics Dashboard tracks employee attrition across demographics, job role, and salary levels, helping HR pinpoint turnover hotspots.
